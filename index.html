                As a recent graduate in fashion design and styling, I bring a fresh perspective and
                 a passion for creative expression to the industry. My educational background has equipped me 
                 with a solid foundation in design principles, trend analysis, and garment construction. 
                 During my internship at the renowned fashion brand Maison Kimhekim, I had the invaluable 
                 opportunity to immerse myself in the fast-paced world of high-end fashion, where I honed my 
                 skills in both design and styling. This experience allowed me to collaborate with a talented team, 
                 refine my attention to detail, and gain insights into the intricate processes of bringing a collection 
                 to life. Eager to contribute my innovative ideas and dedication to the dynamic field of fashion, 
                 I am poised to embark on a fulfilling career where my creativity and industry exposure will thrive.
